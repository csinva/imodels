    """
    The class object for computing MDI+ feature importances for a forest or collection of trees.
    Generalized mean decrease in impurity (MDI+) is a flexible framework for computing RF
    feature importances. For more details, refer to [paper].

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimators: list of fitted PartialPredictionModelBase objects or scikit-learn type estimators
        The fitted partial prediction models (one per tree) to use for evaluating
        feature importance via MDI+. If not a PartialPredictionModelBase, then
        the estimator is coerced into a PartialPredictionModelBase object via
        GenericRegressorPPM or GenericClassifierPPM depending on the specified
        task. Note that these generic PPMs may be computationally expensive.
    transformers: list of BlockTransformerBase objects
        The block feature transformers used to generate blocks of engineered
        features for each original feature. The transformed data is then used
        as input into the partial prediction models. Should be the same length
        as estimators.
    scoring_fns: a function or dict with functions as value and function name (str) as key
        The scoring functions used for evaluating the partial predictions.
    sample_split: string in {"loo", "oob", "inbag"} or None
        The sample splitting strategy to be used when evaluating the partial
        model predictions. The default "loo" (leave-one-out) is strongly
        recommended for performance and in particular, for overcoming the known
        correlation and entropy biases suffered by MDI. "oob" (out-of-bag) can
        also be used to overcome these biases. "inbag" is the sample splitting
        strategy used by MDI. If None, no sample splitting is performed and the
        full data set is used to evaluate the partial model predictions.
    tree_random_states: list of int or None
        Random states from each tree in the fitted random forest; used in
        sample splitting and only required if sample_split = "oob" or "inbag".
        Should be the same length as estimators.
    mode: string in {"keep_k", "keep_rest"}
        Mode for the method. "keep_k" imputes the mean of each feature not
        in block k when making a partial model prediction, while "keep_rest"
        imputes the mean of each feature in block k. "keep_k" is strongly
        recommended for computational considerations.
    by_transformer: bool
        Flag for whether to compute the feature importances by transformer block.
    task: string in {"regression", "classification"}
        The supervised learning task for the RF model. Used for choosing
        defaults for the scoring_fns. Currently only regression and
        classification are supported.
    center: bool
        Flag for whether to center the transformed data in the transformers.
    normalize: bool
        Flag for whether to rescale the transformed data to have unit
        variance in the transformers.

        Parameters

        B: int
            Number of bootstrap samples.
        metrics: "auto" or a dict with functions as value and function name (str) as key
            Metric(s) used to evaluate the stability between two sets of feature importances.
            If "auto", then the feature importance stability metrics are:
                (1) Rank-based overlap (RBO) with p=0.9 (from "A Similarity Measure for
                Indefinite Rankings" by Webber et al. (2010)). Intuitively, this metric gives
                more weight to features with the largest importances, with most of the weight
                going to the ~1/(1-p) features with the largest importances.
                (2) A weighted kendall tau metric (tauAP_b from "The Treatment of Ties in
                AP Correlation" by Urbano and Marrero (2017)), which also gives more weight
                to the features with the largest importances, but uses a different weighting
                scheme from RBO.
            Note that these default metrics assume that a higher MDI+ score indicates
            greater importance and thus give more weight to these features with high
            importance/ranks. If a lower MDI+ score indicates higher importance, then invert
            either these stability metrics or the MDI+ scores before evaluating the stability.
